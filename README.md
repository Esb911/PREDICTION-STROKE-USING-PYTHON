PREDICTION STROKE USING PYTHON


This project aims to build a stroke prediction model using Python and machine learning techniques. By analyzing medical and lifestyle-related data, the model helps identify individuals at risk of stroke.





Key Features


âœ… Data Analysis â€“ Explore and visualize data to understand stroke-related factors.

âœ… Data Preprocessing â€“ Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables.

âœ… Feature Engineering â€“ Select relevant features to enhance model accuracy.

âœ… Machine Learning Models â€“ Utilize algorithms like Decision Tree and Random Forest for stroke prediction.

âœ… Model Evaluation â€“ Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.






Dataset


The dataset used is healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv, which contains medical information such as:


Age, gender, hypertension, heart disease

Marital status, work type, residence type

Body Mass Index (BMI), average glucose level

Smoking history

Technologies & Libraries Used

ðŸ“Œ Python

ðŸ“Œ Pandas & NumPy â€“ Data manipulation and analysis

ðŸ“Œ Matplotlib & Seaborn â€“ Data visualization

ðŸ“Œ Scikit-Learn â€“ Preprocessing, model training, and evaluation

ðŸ“Œ mpl_toolkits (3D Visualization) â€“ For advanced data visualization


Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the required packages:

1. pandas â†’ pip install pandas
2. numpy â†’ pip install numpy
3. os & warnings â†’ These are built-in Python modules, no installation required
4. matplotlib â†’ pip install matplotlib
5. seaborn â†’ pip install seaborn
6. scikit-learn (sklearn) â†’ pip install scikit-learn
7. mpl_toolkits (Axes3D) â†’ Included in matplotlib, so installing matplotlib is enough.
